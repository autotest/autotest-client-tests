Description:
------------
Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling the
traditional one-letter options.

this means that command line options can have long names instead of single
letters, and are introduced with a double dash `--'.

Optionally, Getopt::Long can support the traditional bundling of single-letter
command line options.

How to run?
