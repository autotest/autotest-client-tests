Package:gdk-pixbuf2

Description:
The Gdk Pixbuf is a toolkit for image loading and pixel buffer manipulation. It is used by GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 to load and manipulate images. In the past it was distributed as part of GTK+ 2 but it was split off into a separate package in preparation for the change to GTK+ 3. 

Description about Package deliverables:
libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so  - contains functions used to load and render images.
libgdk_pixbuf_xlib-2.0.so - contains functions used to manipulate images and interfaces with Xlib.

gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders - collects information about loadable modules for Gdk Pixbuf and writes it to the default cache file location, or to stdout.
