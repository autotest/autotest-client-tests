Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol.
Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are provided. More sophisticated interactive features are provided because connecting
 to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a program designed for human interaction. These interactive features include the
ability to specify a time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a shell.

Other reasons to use this module than strictly with a TELNET port are:

    You're not familiar with sockets and you want a simple way to make client connections to TCP services.
    You want to be able to specify your own time-out while connecting, reading, or writing.
    You're communicating with an interactive program at the other end of some socket or pipe and you want to wait for certain patterns to appear.


How to run the test:
--------------------
./perl-Net-Telnet.sh
