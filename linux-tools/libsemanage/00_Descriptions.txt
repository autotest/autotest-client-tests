Descirpton:
-----------
libsemanage provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well as
by programs such as load_policy, which must perform specific transformations
on binary policies (for example, customizing policy boolean settings).

Tests included:
--------------
-test_semanage_store
-test_utilities

But "libsemanage-tests" is a wrapper which implicitly runs the above two tests.

How to run:
-----------
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libsemanage/tests
./libsemanage-tests
