Testcase for libconfig.

Libconfig is a library for reading, manipulating, and writing structured
configuration files.
Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration files.
This file format is more compact and more readable than XML.
And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string parsing
in application code.
Libconfig is very compact — a fraction of the size of the expat XML parser
library.
This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained systems like handheld
devices.
The library features a fully reentrant parser and includes bindings for both
the C and C++ programming languages.

To use the library from C code, include "#include <libconfig.h>"  and
To use the library from C++, include "#include <libconfig.h++>"

How to execute the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libconfig
Execute ./libconfig.sh
