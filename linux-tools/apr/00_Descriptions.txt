Apache Portable Runtime Library (APR) is supporting library used by the applications to achieve platform independence.
APR provides a predictable and consistent interface to underlying platform-specific implementations with a set of APIs which map to the underlying OS.
When the OS doesn't support a particular function, apr will provide an emulation for that function.

The primary core subsystems of apr include:

Atomic operations
Dynamic Shared Object loading
File I/O
Locks (mutexes, condition variables, etc)
Memory management (high performance allocators)
Memory-mapped files
Multicast Sockets
Network I/O
Shared memory
Thread and Process management
Various data structures (tables, hashes, priority queues, etc)

APR package provides the library:
/usr/lib64/libapr-1.so.0
