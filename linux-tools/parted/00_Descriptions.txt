GNU Parted manipulates partition tables.
This is useful for creating space for new operating systems,
reorganizing disk usage, copying data on hard disks and disk
imaging. The package contains a library, libparted, as well
as well as a command-line frontend, parted, which can also be
used in scripts.

Run the test
---------------
./parted.sh
