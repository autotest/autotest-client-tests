/*
** Time Related Type Definitions
**
** An HPI time value represents time as either the number of nanoseconds
** since startup (called "relative time") or as the number of
** nanoseconds since 00:00:00, January 1, 1970 (called "absolute time").
** Any time value less than or equal to 0x0C00000000000000 is
** interpreted as "relative time".  Any time value greater than this
** value is interpreted as "absolute time".
**
** When reporting a relative time, the specific meaning of "startup"
** is implementation dependent.  It may mean, for example, system boot,
** startup of the HPI implementation, startup of a particular resource, etc.
**
** With the exception of event log entry timestamps, it is implementation-
** dependent whether absolute or relative time is used for each time value
** passed to an HPI User.  For event log entry timestamps, the default
** representation is implementation-specific.  However, an HPI User can
** change the representation used on subsequent event log entries by calling
** saHpiEventLogTimeSet().
**
** HPI time values can represent relative times in a range of 0 to 27 years
** and absolute times from 1997 through 2262.  Specific HPI implementations
** may not be able to support these entire ranges.  However, all HPI
** implementations must be able to report appropriate time values during the
** life of the system.
**
** For event log timestamps, all HPI implementations must support relative
** times in the range of 0 to the longest time since "startup" that is ever
** expected to be encountered and absolute times representing current time
** throughout the expected life of the system.
**
** It should be noted that although nano-second resolution is supported
** in the data type, the actual resolution provided by an implementation
** may be more limited than this.
**
** The value -2**63, which is 0x8000000000000000, is used to indicate
** "unknown/unspecified time".
**
** Conversion to/from POSIX and other common time representations is
** relatively straightforward. The following code framgment converts
** between SaHpiTimeT and time_t:
**
**     time_t tt1, tt2;
**     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**
**     time(&tt1);
**     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tt1 * 1000000000;
**     tt2 = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
**
** The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timeval:
**
**     struct timeval tv1, tv2;
**     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**
**     gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
**     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tv1.tv_sec * 1000000000 + tv1.tv_usec * 1000;
**     tv2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
**     tv2.tv_usec = saHpiTime % 1000000000 / 1000;
**
** The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timespec:
**
**     struct timespec ts1, ts2;
**     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**
**     clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts1);
**     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) ts1.tv_sec * 1000000000 + ts1.tv_nsec;
**     ts2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
**     ts2.tv_nsec = saHpiTime % 1000000000;
**
** Note, however, that since time_t is (effectively) universally 32 bits,
** all of these conversions will cease to work on January 18, 2038.
** In any of these conversions, if the SaHpiTimeT value is less than or
** equal to 0x0C00000000000000, then the POSIX time structure represents
** time since startup.  If the SaHpiTimeT value is greater than this
** value, then the POSIX time structure represents absolute time of day.

** Text Buffers
**
** These structures are used for defining the type of data in the text buffer
** and the length of the buffer. Text buffers are used in many places for
** variable length strings of data.
**
** The encoding of the Data field in the SaHpiTextBufferT structure is defined
** by the value of the DataType field in the buffer.  The following table
** describes the various encodings:
**
**    DataType                     Encoding
**    --------                     --------
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_UNICODE         16-bit Unicode.  See Note 3 below.
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BCDPLUS         8-bit ASCII, "0"-"9" or space, dash, period,
**                                 colon, comma, or underscore only.
**                                 See Note 2 below.
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_ASCII6          8-bit ASCII, reduced set, 0x20=0x5f only.
**                                 See Note 2 below.
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_TEXT            8-bit ASCII+Latin 1.  See Note 1 below.
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BINARY          8-bit bytes, any values legal
**
** Note 1: "ASCII+Latin 1" is derived from the first 256 characters of
**        Unicode 2.0. The first 256 codes of Unicode follow ISO 646 (ASCII)
**        and ISO 8859/1 (Latin 1). The Unicode "C0 Controls and Basic Latin"
**        set defines the first 128 8-bit characters (00h-7Fh) and the
**        "C1 Controls and Latin 1 Supplement" defines the second 128 (80h-FFh).
**
** Note 2: The SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BCDPLUS and SAHPI_TL_TYPE_ASCII6 encodings
**        use normal ASCII character encodings, but restrict the allowed
**        characters to a subset of the entire ASCII character set. These
**        encodings are used when the target device contains restrictions
**        on which characters it can store or display.  SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BCDPLUS
**        data may be stored externally as 4-bit values, and
**        SAHPI_TL_TYPE_ASCII6 may be stored externally as 6-bit values.
**        But, regardless of how the data is stored externally, it is
**        encoded as 8-bit ASCII in the SaHpiTextBufferT structure passed
**        across the HPI.
**
** Note 3: Unicode data is encoded according to the UTF-16LE encoding scheme
**       as defined in the UNICODE 4.0 standard.  This encoding scheme stores
**       21-bit UNICODE code points in a series of 16-bit values stored
**       least-siginficant-byte first in the SaHpiTextBufferT Data field.
**       The SaHpiTextBufferT DataLength field contains the number of bytes,
**       so must always be an even number (maximum 0xFE) when the DataType is
**       SAHPI_TL_TYPE_UNICODE.  In addition to containing an even number of
**       bytes, the text buffer must also contain a well-formed UTF-16LE
**       sequence (meaning no "unmatched surrogates" may be present), and
**       must not include encodings of any UNICODE "Non-Characters" in order
**       to be considered valid.  More details can be found in the Unicode
**       specification available at www.unicode.org.

/*
** Entity Types
**
** An Entity is a physical hardware component of the system. Entities are
** defined with an entity type enumeration, and an entity location number
** (to identify the physical location of a particular type of entity).
**
** Entities are uniquely identified in a system with an ordered series of
** Entity Type / Entity Location pairs called an "Entity Path". Each subsequent
** Entity Type/Entity Location in the path is the next higher "containing"
** entity. The "root" of the Entity Path (the outermost level of containment)
** is designated with an Entity Type of SAHPI_ENT_ROOT if the entire Entity Path
** is fewer than SAHPI_MAX_ENTITY_PATH entries in length.
**
** Enumerated Entity Types include those types enumerated by the IPMI Consortium
** for IPMI-managed entities, as well as additional types defined by the
** HPI specification.
** Future versions of this specification may add new Entity Types to this
** enumerated type. Room is left in the enumeration for the inclusion of Entity
** Types taken from other lists, if needed in the future.
** Legacy HPI Users should consider these new entity types "valid but unknown".

** as given in the Range field of the Sensor RDR.
**
** Thresholds are required to be set in-order (such that the setting for
** UpCritical is greater than or equal to the setting for UpMajor, etc.).
**
** A high-going threshold asserts an event state when the reading is
** greater-than or equal-to the threshold value.  And a low-going threshold
** asserts an event state when the reading is less-than or equal-to the
** threshold value.
**
** The PosThdHysteresis and NegThdHysteresis factor into when the deassertion
** events occur.  A high-going threshold must have the reading drop to a
** value that is less than PosThdHysteresis below the threshold value in
** order for the deassertion event to occur.  A low-going threshold must have
** the reading rise to a value that is greater than NegThdHysteresis above the
** threshold to become deasserted.
**
** Note that a zero hysteresis value still leads to a difference between where
** the deassertion events occur.  An event cannot be in the asserted and
** deasserted states simultaneously.  Thus, for zero hysteresis a high-going
** threshold event becomes asserted when the reading is greater-than or
** equal-to the threshold, and becomes deasserted when the reading goes
** less-than the threshold.  A low-going threshold event becomes asserted when
** the reading goes less-than or equal-to the threshold, and becomes deasserted

/*
** Watchdog Structure
**
** This structure is used by the saHpiWatchdogTimerGet() and
** saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() functions. The use of the structure varies slightly
** by each function.
**
** For saHpiWatchdogTimerGet() :
**
**   Log -                indicates whether or not the Watchdog is configured to
**                        issue events. True=events are generated.
**   Running -            indicates whether or not the Watchdog is currently
**                        running or stopped. True=Watchdog is running.
**   TimerUse -           indicates the current use of the timer; one of the
**                        enumerated preset uses which was included on the last
**                        saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() function call, or through some
**                        other implementation-dependent means to start the
**                        Watchdog timer.
**   TimerAction -        indicates what action will be taken when the Watchdog
**                        times out.
**   PretimerInterrupt -  indicates which action will be taken
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" milliseconds prior to Watchdog
**                        timer expiration.
**   PreTimeoutInterval - indicates how many milliseconds prior to timer time
**                        out the PretimerInterrupt action will be taken. If
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" = 0, the PretimerInterrupt action
**                        occurs concurrently with "TimerAction". HPI
**                        implementations may not be able to support millisecond
**                        resolution, and because of this may have rounded the
**                        set value to whatever resolution could be supported.
**                        The HPI implementation returns this rounded value.
**   TimerUseExpFlags -   set of five bit flags which indicate that a Watchdog
**                        timer timeout has occurred while the corresponding
**                        TimerUse value was set. Once set, these flags stay
**                        set until specifically cleared with a
**                        saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() call, or by some other
**                        implementation-dependent means.
**   InitialCount -       The time, in milliseconds, before the timer will time
**                        out after the Watchdog is started/restarted, or some
**                        other implementation-dependent strobe is
**                        sent to the Watchdog. HPI implementations may not be
**                        able to support millisecond resolution, and because
**                        of this may have rounded the set value to whatever
**                        resolution could be supported.  The HPI implementation
**                        returns this rounded value.
**   PresentCount -       The remaining time in milliseconds before the timer
**                        times out unless a saHpiWatchdogTimerReset()
**                        function call is made, or some other implementation-
**                        dependent strobe is sent to the Watchdog.
**                        HPI implementations may not be able to support
**                        millisecond resolution on Watchdog Timers, but
**                        returns the number of clock ticks remaining times the
**                        number of milliseconds between each tick.
**
** For saHpiWatchdogTimerSet():
**
**   Log -                indicates whether or not the Watchdog should issue
**                        events. True=events are generated.
**   Running -            indicates whether or not the Watchdog should be
**                        stopped before updating.
**                        True =  Watchdog is not stopped. If it is
**                                already stopped, it remains stopped,
**                                but if it is running, it continues
**                                to run, with the countown timer reset
**                                to the new InitialCount.  Note that
**                                there is a race condition possible
**                                with this setting, so it should be used
**                                with care.
**                        False = Watchdog is stopped. After
**                                saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() is called, a
**                                subsequent call to
**                                saHpiWatchdogTimerReset() is required
**                                to start the timer.
**   TimerUse -           indicates the current use of the timer. Controls
**                        which TimerUseExpFlag will be set if the timer
**                        expires.
**   TimerAction -        indicates what action will be taken when the Watchdog
**                        times out.
**   PretimerInterrupt -  indicates which action will be taken
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" milliseconds prior to Watchdog
**                        timer expiration.
**   PreTimeoutInterval - indicates how many milliseconds prior to timer time
**                        out the PretimerInterrupt action will be taken. If
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" = 0, the PretimerInterrupt action
**                        occurs concurrently with "TimerAction". HPI
**                        implementations may not be able to support millisecond
**                        resolution and may have a maximum value restriction.
**                        These restrictions should be documented by the
**                        provider of the HPI interface.
**   TimerUseExpFlags -   Set of five bit flags corresponding to the five
**                        TimerUse values. For each bit set to "1", the
**                        corresponding Timer Use Expiration Flag is cleared,
**                        that is, set to "0". Generally, a program should only
**                        clear the Timer Use Expiration Flag corresponding to
**                        its own TimerUse, so that other software, which may
**                        have used the timer for another purpose in the past
**                        can still read its TimerUseExpFlag to determine
**                        whether or not the timer expired during that use.
**   InitialCount -       The time, in milliseconds, before the timer will time
**                        out after a saHpiWatchdogTimerReset() function call is
**                        made, or some other implementation-dependent strobe is
**                        sent to the Watchdog. HPI implementations may not be
**                        able to support millisecond resolution and may have a
**                        maximum value restriction. These restrictions should
**                        be documented by the provider of the HPI interface.
**   PresentCount -       Not used on saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() function. Ignored.

** Resource Capabilities
**
** This definition defines the capabilities of a given resource. One resource
** may support any number of capabilities using the bit mask. Because each entry
** in an RPT has the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RESOURCE bit set, zero is not a
** valid value for the capability flag, and is thus used to indicate "no RPT
** entry present" in some function calls.
**
** Future versions of the HPI specification may define additional resource
** capabilities and associate them with currently undefined bit positions in
** the SaHpiCapabilitiesT bit mask.  Implementations conforming to this
** version of the HPI specification should set all undefined bit values to
** zero in the ResourceCapabilities field of all Rpt entries.  However,
** HPI Users should not assume undefined bit values are zero, to
** remain compatible with HPI implementations that implement future versions
** of the specification.
**
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RESOURCE
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS
**   Indicates that all Sensors on the resource have the property that their
**   Assertion and Deassertion event enable flags are the same. That is,
**   for all event states whose assertion triggers an event, it is
**   guaranteed that the deassertion of that event state also
**   triggers an event. Thus, an HPI User may track the state of Sensors on the
**   resource by monitoring events rather than polling for event state changes.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_AGGREGATE_STATUS
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONFIGURATION
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_MANAGED_HOTSWAP
**   Indicates that the resource supports the managed hot swap model.
**   Since hot swap only makes sense for field-replaceable units, the
**    SAHPI_CAPABILITY_FRU capability bit must also be set for this resource.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_WATCHDOG
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONTROL
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_FRU
**   Indicates that the resource is associated with an entity that is a
**   field-replaceable unit; i.e., it is capable of being removed and
**   replaced in a live system. If SAHPI_CAPABILITY_MANAGED_HOTSWAP is also
**   set, the resource supports the managed hot swap model.  If
**   SAHPI_CAPABILITY_MANAGED_HOTSWAP is not set, the resource supports the
**   simplified hot swap model.

**   been dropped or overwritten due to a table overflow.
** The OverflowAction entry indicates the behavior of the Event Log when an

** provided by specific event logs in an HPI implementation.  A separate
** value is returned for each event log maintained by an HPI implementation,
** so different event logs may have different capabilities.
**

** by saHpiEventLogCapabilitiesGet().  If the event log does not support the
** corresponding capability, the bit is set to "0".

** remain compatible with HPI implementations that implement future versions
** of the specification.

**
**  SAHPI_EVTLOG_CAPABILITY_ENTRY_ADD

**     events added to a domain via the saHpiEventAdd() function may be added
**     to an event log by the HPI implementation.
**  SAHPI_EVTLOG_CAPABILITY_CLEAR
**     The saHpiEventLogClear() function may be used to clear the event log.
**  SAHPI_EVTLOG_CAPABILITY_TIME_SET
**     The saHpiEventLogTimeSet() function may be used to set the event log
**     clock.
**  SAHPI_EVTLOG_CAPABILITY_STATE_SET
**     The saHpiEventLogStateSet() function may be used to enable or disable
**     automatic logging of events in the event log.
**  SAHPI_EVTLOG_CAPABILITY_OVERFLOW_RESET

**
**   Since entities are contained within other entities, there may be multiple

**
**   If there are multiple resources that could be returned, each with the same

**
** Remarks:
**   This function can be used two ways. 
**   If InstrumentType is set to SAHPI_NO_RECORD, then it returns the ResourceId
**   of a resource that provides any management access to the requested entity.
**   A resource provides management access to an entity if any management
**   instrument contained in that resource is associated with the entity, or if
**   the resource's other (non-management-instrument) capabilities are
**   associated with the entity. In other words, given an entity path, a
**   resource is found to provide management access to the entity if the entity
**   path in the RPT entry for the resource matches, or if the entity path in
**   any RDR contained in the resource matches.  Entity paths must match
**   exactly.
**
**   If InstrumentType is set to indicate a particular type of management
**   instrument, then the function returns both the ResourceId and InstrumentId
**   (e.g., Sensor number, Control number, DIMI number, FUMI number, etc.) for a
**   management instrument of the requested type that provides management access
**   to the requested entity.  Entity paths must match exactly.  In this case,
**   it only returns the ResourceId of a resource that has a management
**   instrument of the requested type associated with the requested entity, and
**   it may return the same ResourceId several times, each time with a different
**   InstrumentId.
**
**   For any entity, it is possible that there are multiple resources that
**   provide management access, or that there are multiple management
**   instruments of the requested type in one or more resources providing
**   management access.  To retrieve all appropriate ResourceId values or all
**   appropriate ResourceId/InstrumentId pairs, multiple calls to
**   saHpiGetIdByEntityPath() must be made.  The first call should set
**   InstanceId  to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY. On subsequent calls, the InstanceId value
**   set upon return can be passed as input on a subsequent call to get the next
**   appropriate ResourceId or ResourceId/InstrumentId pair.  When the last
**   appropriate ResourceId or ResourceId/InstrumentId pair is returned, the
**   returned InstanceId value is SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY.  The order in which
**   ResourceId or ResourceId/InstrumentId pairs are returned is implementation
**   specific.
**
**   It is possible that resources may be added to or removed from a domain
**   between successive calls to this function. As a result, the InstanceId
**   returned in a previous call to this function may become invalid. The
**   RptUpdateCount is provided to notify the HPI User of this condition. The
**   returned RptUpdateCount value should be checked against the last returned
**   value every time this function is called with InstanceId other than
**   SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY. If it differs, then the RPT has been updated and the
**   search should be restarted with InstanceId set to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY. The
**   HPI User should also check RptUpdateCount when SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is
**   returned while calling this function with InstanceId set to a value other
**   than SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY.  If it has changed from the previous call, the
**   error return is probably due to the change in the RPT, and the search
**   process should be restarted.
**
**   The values returned by this function for ResourceId, InstrumentId, and
**   InstanceId are only valid if:
**   a)the function was called with InstanceId equal to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY, or 
**   b)the function was called with InstanceId equal to the value returned by a
**   previous call to the function on the same session, passing the same values
**   for EntityPath and InstrumentType, and with the same value for
**   RptUpdateCount returned on both calls.
**
**   In all other cases, even if the function returns SA_OK, the values returned
**   for ResourceId, InstrumentId, and InstanceId are not valid, and should be

** Name: saHpiGetChildEntityPath()
**
** Description:
**   This function retrieves entities that are contained within a given entity.
**   The entity path of a containing entity ("parent") is passed to the function
**   and the entity path of a contained entity ("child"), if available, is
**   returned.
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ParentEntityPath - [in] EntityPath of parent entity. 
**   InstanceId - [in/out] Pointer to the instance number of the child entity
**      path to be returned. On return, this value is updated to the instance
**      number of the next child entity path for the passed parent entity path,
**      or to SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY if there are no more. Reserved InstanceId values:
**   SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY 	Get first child entity for entity described by
**      ParentEntityPath.
**   SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY  	Reserved as delimiter for end of list. Not a valid entry
**      identifier.
**   ChildEntityPath - [out] Pointer to the entity path of a child entity.
**   RptUpdateCount - [out] Pointer to a location to store the current value of
**      the RptUpdateCount field from the domain info data for the domain.  This
**      value is stored when the function returns SA_OK,
**      SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA, or SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the:
**      * InstanceId pointer is passed in as NULL.
**      * InstanceId points to an invalid reserved value such as
**         SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY.
**      * RptUpdateCount pointer is passed in as NULL.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if the entity represented by
**      ParentEntityPath is not present in the current Domain Entity Tree.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned when:
**      * InstanceId is SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY and no child entity for entity
**         described by ParentEntityPath is present.
**      * InstanceId is not SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY and no child entity
**         corresponding to InstanceId for entity described by
**         ParentEntityPath is present.
**
** Remarks:
**   This function provides access to the Domain Entity Tree for the domain
**   associated with the open SessionId.  Passed an entity path that identifies
**   a node in the Domain Entity Tree, the function returns entity paths that
**   identify the immediate children of that node; that is, the entity paths for
**   entities in the Domain Entity Tree that are immediately contained by the
**   entity whose entity path was passed as ParentEntityPath.
**
**   For any entity path, it is possible that there are multiple immediate
**   children in the Domain Entity Tree.  To retrieve the entity paths for all
**   children or a particular ParentEntityPath, multiple calls to
**   saHpiGetChildEntityPath() must be made.  On each call, the InstanceId value
**   set upon return can be passed as input on a subsequent call to get the
**   entity path for the next child.  When the entity path for the last child of
**   the passed ParentEntityPath is returned, then InstanceId is set to
**   SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY.  The order in which ChildEntityPath values are returned
**   is implementation specific.
**
**   To retrieve the entire Domain Entity Tree, an HPI User can start by calling
**   this function with an entity path containing only { { SAHPI_ROOT, 0 } } to
**   retrieve children of the root node, then calling the function recursively
**   for each of those children, and so forth.
**
**   It is possible that resources may be added to or removed from a domain
**   between successive calls to this function. As a result, the Domain Entity
**   Tree may change, invalidating data previously returned. The RptUpdateCount
**   is provided to notify the HPI User of this condition. The returned
**   RptUpdateCount value should be checked against the last returned value
**   every time this function is called with InstanceId other than
**   SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY. If it differs, then the RPT has been updated and the
**   entire sequence of calls should be restarted. The HPI User should also
**   check RptUpdateCount when SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA or SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT
**   is returned while calling this function with InstanceId set to a value
**   other than SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY.  If it has changed from the previous call,
**   the error return is probably due to the change in the RPT, and the search
**   entire sequence of calls should be restarted.
**
**   The values returned by this function for ChildEntityPath, and InstanceId
**   are only valid if:
**   a)the function was called with InstanceId equal to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY, or 
**   b)the function was called with InstanceId equal to the value returned by a
**   previous call to the function on the same session, passing the same value
**   for ParentEntityPath, and with the same value for RptUpdateCount returned
**   on both calls.
**   In all other cases, even if the function returns SA_OK, the values returned
**   for ChildEntityPath and InstanceId are not valid, and should be ignored.

**
** Description:
**   This function allows an HPI User to remove an RPT entry for a failed

**   entry for a failed resource associated with a FRU that is not functional or
**   has lost management access. If the HPI User acquires knowledge that the FRU
**   associated with such a resource has been physically removed, then this
**   function provides the means to update the RPT so that it no longer contains
**   an entry for that resource.
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**
** Return value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the ResourceId pointer is passed
**      in as NULL.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if an entry for the resource identified
**      by ResourceId is not present in the RPT.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_REQUEST is returned if the ResourceFailed flag in the
**      resource's RPT entry is not set to True.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_CMD is returned if the resource is not associated with a
**      FRU, as indicated by SAHPI_CAPABILITY_FRU in the ResourceCapabilities
**      field of the resource's RPT entry.
**
** Remarks:
**   This function can be used only on failed resources that are associated with
**   FRUs. Resources that either do not represent FRUs or, do no have the
**   ResourceFailed flag in ther RPT entry set to True cannot be removed by this
**   function. See Section 3.8.2 for more information on failed resources
**   representing FRUs.
**
**   When the HPI User calls this function for a failed resource, the HPI

**   indicating that the saHpiEventLogEntryAdd() function did not add the event

**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_CMD is returned if the addressed event log does not

**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned when the Time parameter is set to
**      SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED.
**   For situations when the underlying implementation cannot represent a time
**      value that is specified in Time, SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned.
**
** Remarks:
**   If the Time parameter value is less than or equal to
**   SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, but not SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED, then it is
**   relative; if it is greater than SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, then it is
**   absolute.  Setting this parameter to the value SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED is
**   invalid and results in an error return code of SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS.
**
**   Entries placed in the Event Log after this function is called will have
**   Event Log timestamps (i.e., the Timestamp field in the SaHpiEventLogEntryT
**   structure) based on the new time.  Setting the clock does not affect
**   existing Event Log entries.  If the time is set to a relative time,
**   subsequent entries placed in the Event Log will have an Event Log timestamp
**   expressed as a relative time; if the time is set to an absolute time,
**   subsequent entries will have an Event Log timestamp expressed as an
**   absolute time.
**
**   This function only sets the Event Log time clock and does not have any
**   direct bearing on the timestamps placed on events (i.e., the Timestamp
**   field in the SaHpiEventT structure), or the timestamps placed in the domain
**   RPT info record.  Setting the clocks used to generate timestamps other than
**   Event Log timestamps is implementation-dependent, and should be documented
**   by the HPI implementation provider.
**
**   Some underlying implementations may not be able to handle the same relative
**   and absolute time ranges, as those defined in HPI.  Such limitations should
**   be documented.  When a time value is set in a region that is not supported
**   by the implementation, an error code of SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is
**   returned.  However, all HPI implementations must support setting the event
**   log time to relative times in the range of 0 to the longest time since
**   "startup" that is ever expected to be encountered and absolute times
**   representing current time throughout the expected life of the system.  See
**   Section  for more details on time ranges.

**
** Return Value:

**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_REQUEST is returned if an HPI User is not currently
**      subscribed for events in this session.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the:
**      * Event pointer is passed in as NULL.
**      * Timeout parameter is not set to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK,
**         SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE or a positive value.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_TIMEOUT is returned if no event is available to return within
**      the timeout period.  If SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE is passed in the Timeout
**      parameter, this error return is used if there is no event queued when
**      the function is called.
**
** Remarks:
**   SaHpiEventGet()also returns an EventQueueStatus flag to an HPI User.  This
**   flag indicates whether or not a queue overflow has occurred.  The overflow
**   flag is set if any events were unable to be queued because of space
**   limitations in the interface implementation.  The overflow flag is reset
**   whenever saHpiEventGet() is called.
**
**   If there are one or more events on the event queue when this function is
**   called, it immediately returns the next event on the queue.  Otherwise, if
**   the Timeout parameter is SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE, it returns
**   SA_ERR_HPI_TIMEOUT immediately.  Otherwise, it blocks for the time
**   specified by the timeout parameter; if an event is added to the queue
**   within that time it is returned immediately when added; if not,
**   saHpiEventGet() returns SA_ERR_HPI_TIMEOUT at the end of the timeout
**   period.  If the Timeout parameter is SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK, the
**   saHpiEventGet()blocks indefinitely, until an event becomes available, and
**   then returns that event.  This provides for notification of events as they
**   occur.
**
**   If an HPI User provides a pointer for an RPT entry, but the event does not
**   include a valid ResourceId for a resource in the domain, then the
**   RptEntry->ResourceCapabilities field is set to zero.  No valid RPT entry
**   has a ResourceCapabilities field equal to zero.
**
**   If an HPI User provides a pointer for an RDR, but there is no valid RDR
**   associated with the event being returned, then the Rdr->RdrType field is
**   set to SAHPI_NO_RECORD. RDRs should be returned for events associated with
**   management instruments.   Event types that are associated with management
**   instruments are identified in Section 8.18.
**
**   The timestamp reported in the returned event structure is the best
**   approximation an implementation has to when the event actually occurred.
**   The implementation may need to make an approximation (such as the time the
**   event was placed on the event queue) because it may not have access to the
**   actual time the event occurred.  The value SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED indicates
**   that the time of the event cannot be determined.
**
**   If the implementation cannot supply an absolute timestamp, then it may
**   supply a timestamp relative to some system-defined epoch, such as system
**   startup.  If the timestamp value is less than or equal to
**   SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, but not SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED, then it is
**   relative; if it is greater than SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, then it is
**   absolute.
**
**   If an HPI User passes a NULL pointer for the returned EventQueueStatus
**   pointer, the event status is not returned, but the overflow flag, if set,
**   is still reset.  Thus, if an HPI User needs to know about event queue
**   overflows, the EventQueueStatus parameter should never be NULL, and the
**   overflow flag should be checked after every call to saHpiEventGet().
**
**   If saHpiEventGet() is called with a timeout value other than
**   SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE, and the session is subsequently closed from
**   another thread, this function returns with SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_SESSION.  If
**   saHpiEventGet() is called with a timeout value other than
**   SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE, and an HPI User subsequently calls

**
** Remarks:
**   Specific implementations of HPI may have restrictions on how much data may

**
** Description:
**   This function allows an HPI User to acknowledge a single alarm entry or a

**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using

**   AlarmId - [in] Identifier of the alarm to be acknowledged.  Reserved
**      AlarmId values:
**      * SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED	Ignore this parameter.
**   Severity - [in] Severity level of alarms to acknowledge.  Ignored unless
**      AlarmId is SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if an alarm entry identified by the
**      AlarmId parameter does not exist in the DAT.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if AlarmId is SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED
**      and Severity is not one of the valid enumerated values for this type.
**
** Remarks:
**   An HPI User acknowledges an alarm to indicate that it is aware of the alarm
**   and to influence platform-specific alarm annunciation that may be provided
**   by the implementation.  Typically, an implementation ignores acknowledged
**   alarms when announcing an alarm on annunciation devices such as audible
**   sirens and dry contact closures.  However, alarm annunciation is
**   implementation-specific.
**
**   An acknowledged alarm has the Acknowledged field in the alarm entry set to
**   True.
**
**   Alarms are acknowledged one of two ways: a single alarm entry by AlarmId
**   regardless of severity or a group of alarm entries by Severity regardless
**   of AlarmId.
**
**   To acknowledge all alarms contained within the DAT, set the Severity
**   parameter to SAHPI_ALL_SEVERITIES, and set the AlarmId parameter to
**   SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.
**
**   To acknowledge all alarms of a specific severity contained within the DAT,
**   set the Severity parameter to the appropriate value, and set the AlarmId
**   parameter to SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.
**
**   To acknowledge a single alarm entry, set the AlarmId parameter to a value
**   other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.  The AlarmId must be a valid identifier
**   for an alarm entry present in the DAT at the time of the function call.
**
**   If an alarm has been previously acknowledged, acknowledging it again has no
**   effect.  However, this is not an error.
**
**   If the AlarmId parameter has a value other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED,
**   the Severity parameter is ignored.
**
**   If the AlarmId parameter is passed as SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED, and no
**   alarms are present that meet the requested Severity, this function has no
**   effect.  However, this is not an error.
**
**   SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED is defined as the same value as SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY,
**   so using either symbol has the same effect.  However,
**   SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED should be used with this function for clarity.

**   be updated.  In addition, there is an Action parameter.
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**   SensorNum - [in] Sensor number for which the event enable configuration is

**   Action - [in] Enumerated value describing what change should be made to the
**      Sensor event masks:
**      * SAHPI_SENS_ADD_EVENTS_TO_MASKS - for each bit set to "1" in the
**         AssertEventMask and DeassertEventMask parameters, set the
**         corresponding bit in the Sensor's assert and deassert event masks,
**         respectively, to "1".
**      * SAHPI_SENS_REMOVE_EVENTS_FROM_MASKS - for each bit set to "1" in the
**         AssertEventMask and DeassertEventMask parameters, clear the
**         corresponding bit in the Sensor's assert and deassert event masks,
**         respectively, that is, set the corresponding bits in the event masks
**         to "0".
**   AssertEventMask - [in] Bit mask or special value indicating which bits in
**      the Sensor's assert event mask should be set or cleared. (But see
**      Remarks concerning resources with the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS
**      flag set.)
**   DeassertEventMask - [in] Bit mask or special value indicating which bits in
**      the Sensor's deassert event mask should be set or cleared.  (But see
**      Remarks concerning resources with the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS
**      flag set.)
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support Sensors,
**      as indicated by SAHPI_CAPABILITY_SENSOR in the resource's RPT entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if the Action parameter is
**      SAHPI_SENS_ADD_EVENTS_TO_MASKS, and:
**      * The AssertEventMask parameter is not SAHPI_ALL_EVENT_STATES, and it
**         includes a bit for an event state that is not supported by the
**         Sensor.
**      * The resource does not have the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS
**         capability set, and the DeassertEventMask parameter is not
**         SAHPI_ALL_EVENT_STATES, and it includes a bit for an event state that
**         is not supported by the Sensor.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the Action parameter is out of
**      range.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the Sensor is not present.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned if the Sensor does not support updating
**      the assert and deassert event masks (i.e., the EventCtrl field in the
**      Sensor RDR is set to SAHPI_SEC_READ_ONLY_MASKS or SAHPI_SEC_READ_ONLY).
**
** Remarks:
**   The bits in the Sensor assert and deassert event masks that correspond to
**   "1" bits in the bit-mask parameters are set or cleared, as indicated by the
**   Action parameter.  The bits in the Sensor assert and deassert event masks
**   corresponding to "0" bits in the bit-mask parameters are unchanged.
**
**   Assuming that a Sensor is enabled and event generation for the Sensor is
**   enabled, then for each bit set in the Sensor's assert event mask, an event
**   is generated when the Sensor's corresponding event state changes from
**   deasserted to asserted.  Similarly, for each bit set in the Sensor's
**   deassert event mask, an event is generated when the Sensor's corresponding
**   event state changes from asserted to deasserted.
**
**   For Sensors hosted by a resource that has the
**   SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS flag set in its RPT entry, the assert and
**   deassert event masks cannot be independently configured.  When
**   saHpiSensorEventMasksSet() is called for Sensors in a resource with this
**   capability, the DeassertEventMask parameter is ignored, and the
**   AssertEventMask parameter is used to determine which bits to set or clear
**   in both the assert event mask and deassert event mask for the Sensor.
**
**   The AssertEventMask or DeassertEventMask parameter may be set to the
**   special value, SAHPI_ALL_EVENT_STATES, indicating that all event states
**   supported by the Sensor should be added to or removed from, the
**   corresponding Sensor event mask.
**
**   If the Sensor assert and/or deassert event masks change as a result of this
**   function call, an event is generated.

**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support
**      Controls, as indicated by the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONTROL in the resource's
**      RPT entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if the addressed Control is a text
**      Control, and the line number passed in CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Line
**      does not exist in the Control and is not SAHPI_TLN_ALL_LINES.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the Control is not present.
**
** Remarks:
**   Note that the CtrlState parameter is both an input and an output parameter
**   for this function.  This is necessary to support line number inputs for
**   text Controls, as discussed below.
**
**   As an input parameter, the CtrlState->Type value is not significant for
**   this function and is ignored. It is thus not necessary to set
**   CtrlState->Type to any valid value, even when CtrlState is being used to
**   provide input parameters for specific types of Controls.
**   In some cases, the state of a Control may be set, but the corresponding
**   state cannot be read at a later time.  Such Controls are delineated with
**   the WriteOnly flag in the Control's RDR.
**
**   Note that text Controls are unique in that they have a state associated
**   with each line of the Control - the state being the text on that line. The
**   line number to be read is passed in to saHpiControlGet() via
**   CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Line; the contents of that line of the Control
**   are returned in
**   CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text.  The first line of the text Control is
**   line number "1".
**
**   If the line number passed in is SAHPI_TLN_ALL_LINES, then saHpiControlGet()
**   returns the entire text of the Control, or as much of it as can fit in a
**   single SaHpiTextBufferT, in CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text. This value
**   consists of the text of all the lines concatenated, using the maximum
**   number of characters for each line (no trimming of trailing blanks).
**
**   Note that depending on the data type and language, the text may be encoded
**   in 2-byte Unicode, which requires two bytes of data per character.
**
**   Note that the number of lines and columns in a text Control can be obtained
**   from the Control's Resource Data Record.
**
**   Write-only Controls allow the Control's state to be set, but the Control
**   state cannot be subsequently read.  Such Controls are indicated in the RDR,
**   when the WriteOnly flag is set to True.  SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_CMD is returned
**   when calling this function for a write-only Control.
**
**   It is legal for both the CtrlMode parameter and the CtrlState parameter to
**   be NULL.  In this case, no data is returned other than the return code.

**      * CtrlState->StateUnion.Stream.StreamLength is bigger than
**         SAHPI_CTRL_MAX_STREAM_LENGTH.
**      * SaHpiTextBufferT structure passed as CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text
**         contains text characters that are not allowed according to the value

**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_REQUEST is returned when SAHPI_CTRL_STATE_PULSE_ON is
**      issued to a digital Control, which is ON (in either manual or auto
**      mode).  It is also returned when SAHPI_CTRL_STATE_PULSE_OFF is issued
**      to a digital Control, which is OFF (in either manual or auto mode).
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned when attempting to change the mode of a
**      Control with a read-only mode.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_UNSUPPORTED_PARAMS is returned if an otherwise legal CtrlState
**      value passed is not supported by the addressed Control.  For example, a
**      Discrete Control may only be settable to certain values, or a Digital
**      Control may only be able to accept a "Pulse" operation.  The HPI
**      implementation should provide documentation describing the limitations
**      of specific Controls which may result in this return value.
**
** Remarks:
**   If the CtrlMode parameter is set to SAHPI_CTRL_MODE_AUTO, then the
**   CtrlState parameter is not evaluated, and may be set to any value by an HPI
**   User, including a NULL pointer. When CtrlMode is SAHPI_CTRL_MODE_MANUAL,
**   the CtrlState parameter must be of the correct type for the specified
**   Control.
**
**   Text Controls include a line number and a line of text in the CtrlState
**   parameter, allowing update of just a single line of a text Control. The
**   first line of the text Control is line number "1".  If less than a full
**   line of data is written, the Control clears all spaces beyond those written
**   on the line. Thus writing a zero-length string clears the addressed line.
**
**   It is also possible to include more characters in the text passed in the
**   CtrlState structure than fits on one line; in this case, the Control wraps
**   to the next line (still clearing the trailing characters on the last line
**   written). Thus, there are two ways to write multiple lines to a text
**   Control: (a) call saHpiControlSet() repeatedly for each line, or (b) call
**   saHpiControlSet() once and send more characters than fit on one line. An
**   HPI User should not assume any "cursor positioning" characters are
**   available to use, but rather should always write full lines and allow
**   "wrapping" to occur. When calling saHpiControlSet() for a text Control, an

**      read-only and does not allow addition of Fields.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the:
**      * Field->FieldId  or Field->AreaId  is an invalid reserved value such as
**         SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY.
**      * The Field type is not one of the valid field type enumerated values.
**      * Field type, Field->Type, is set to SAHPI_IDR_FIELDTYPE_UNSPECIFIED.
**      * SaHpiTextBufferT structure passed as part of the Field parameter is
**         not valid.  This occurs when:
**         * The DataType is not one of the enumerated values for that type, or 
**         * The data field contains characters that are not legal according to
**            the value of DataType, or
**         * The Language is not one of the enumerated values for that type when
**            the DataType is SAHPI_TL_TYPE_UNICODE or SAHPI_TL_TYPE_TEXT.
**         * Field pointer is passed in as NULL.
**
** Remarks:
**   On successful completion a new Field with the FieldId specified within the
**   Field parameter is added to the IDA identified by Field->AreaId. Thus this
**   function can be used to add Fields with user specified FieldIds to non
**   read-only Areas.
**
**   The ReadOnly element in the Field parameter is not used by this function.
**   On successful completion, the ReadOnly element in the new Field is always
**   False.
**
**   Addition of a read-only Inventory Data Field is not allowed; therefore the
**   ReadOnly element in the SaHpiIdrFieldT parameter is ignored.
**
**   SAHPI_IDR_FIELDTYPE_UNSPECIFIED is not a valid field type, and should not
**   be used with this function.  If SAHPI_IDR_FIELDTYPE_UNSPECIFIED is
**   specified as the field type, an error code of SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is
**   returned.  This field type is only valid when used with the
**   saHpiIdrFieldGet() function to retrieve fields of an unspecified type.
**
**   Some implementations have restrictions on what fields are valid in specific
**   areas and/or the data format of some fields.  These restrictions should be
**   documented.  SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned when the field type or
**   field data does not meet the implementation-specific restrictions.
**
**   SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY is a valid FieldId and can be used with this function,
**   provided the IDA does not have a pre-existing Field with that FieldId. Upon
**   successful addition, this new Field becomes the first field in the IDA and
**   is returned when retrieving a Field using saHpiIdrFieldGet() with
**   FieldId=SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY. Implementations should document how added Fields
**   are ordered in IDAs.
**
**   The AreaId element within the Field parameter identifies the specific IDA
**   into which the new field is added.

**
** Remarks:
**   This function allows modification of both the FieldType and Field data of a
**   given Inventory Data Field.  This function does not allow modification of

**   is returned.  This field type is only valid when used with the
**   saHpiIdrFieldGet() function to retrieve fields of an unspecified type.
**
**   Some implementations have restrictions on what fields are valid in specific

**      * Watchdog->TimerAction is set to an unsupported value.  See remarks.
**      * Watchdog->TimerUse is set to an unsupported value.  See remarks.
**
** Remarks:
**   Configuring the Watchdog Timer with the saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() function
**   does not start the timer running.  If the timer was previously stopped when
**   this function is called, then it remains stopped, and must be started by
**   calling saHpiWatchdogTimerReset().  If the timer was previously running,
**   then it continues to run if the Watchdog->Running field passed is True, or
**   is stopped if the Watchdog->Running field passed is False.  If it continues
**   to run, it restarts its count-down from the newly configured initial count
**   value.
**
**   If the initial counter value is set to 0, then any configured pre-timer
**   interrupt action or Watchdog Timer expiration action is taken immediately
**   when the Watchdog Timer is started.  This provides a mechanism for software
**   to force an immediate recovery action should that be dependent on a
**   Watchdog timeout occurring.
**
**   See the description of the SaHpiWatchdogT structure for more details on the
**   effects of this command related to specific data passed in that structure.
**
**   Some implementations impose a limit on the acceptable ranges for the
**   PreTimeoutInterval or InitialCount. These limitations must be documented.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if an attempt is made to set a value
**   outside of the supported range.
**
**   Some implementations cannot accept all of the enumerated values for
**   TimerUse, TimerAction, or PretimerInterrupt.  These restrictions should be
**   documented.  SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if an attempt is made to
**   select an unsupported option.

**      otherwise, set to requested severity level.
**   UnacknowledgedOnly - [in] Set to True to indicate only unacknowledged

**
** Return Value:

**
** Remarks:
**   All announcements contained in the set are maintained in the order in which

**   EntryId and Timestamp passed by an HPI User has been deleted.
**
**   Selection can be restricted to only announcements of a specified severity,
**   and/or only unacknowledged announcements. To retrieve all announcements
**   contained meeting specific requirements, call saHpiAnnunciatorGetNext()
**   with the Status->EntryId field set to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY and the Severity
**   and UnacknowledgedOnly parameters set to select what announcements should

**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if EntryId is SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED
**      and Severity is not one of the valid enumerated values for this type.
**
** Remarks:
**   Announcements are acknowledged one of two ways: a single announcement by
**   EntryId regardless of severity or a group of announcements by severity
**   regardless of EntryId.
**
**   An HPI User acknowledges an announcement to influence the platform-specific
**   annunciation provided by the Annunciator management instrument.
**
**   An acknowledged announcement has the Acknowledged field set to True.
**
**   To acknowledge all announcements contained within the current set, set the
**   Severity parameter to SAHPI_ALL_SEVERITIES, and set the EntryId parameter
**   to SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.
**
**   To acknowledge all announcements of a specific severity, set the Severity
**   parameter to the appropriate value, and set the EntryId parameter to
**   SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.
**
**   To acknowledge a single announcement, set the EntryId parameter to a value
**   other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.  The EntryId must be a valid identifier
**   for an announcement present in the current set.
**
**   If an announcement has been previously acknowledged, acknowledging it again
**   has no effect.  However, this is not an error.
**
**   If the EntryId parameter has a value other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED,
**   the Severity parameter is ignored.
**
**   If the EntryId parameter is passed as SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED, and no
**   announcements are present that meet the requested Severity, this function
**   has no effect.  However, this is not an error.
**
**   SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED is defined as the same value as SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY,
**   so using either symbol has the same effect.  However,
**   SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED should be used with this function for clarity.

**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**   AnnunciatorNum - [in] Annunciator number for the addressed Annunciator.
**   Announcement - [in/out] Pointer to structure that contains the new
**      announcement to add to the set.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support
**      Annunciators, as indicated by SAHPI_CAPABILITY_ANNUNCIATOR in the
**      resource's RPT entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the AnnunciatorNum passed does not
**      address a valid Annunciator supported by the resource.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned when:
**      * The Announcement pointer is passed in as NULL.
**      * The Announcement->Severity field is not one of the enumerated values
**         for that type, or it is equal to SAHPI_ALL_SEVERITIES.
**      * The Announcement->StatusCond.Type field is not one of the enumerated
**         values for that type.
**      * The SaHpiNameT structure passed as part of the Announcement structure
**         has a Length field greater than SA_HPI_MAX_NAME_LENGTH.
**      * The SaHpiTextBufferT structure passed as part of the Announcement

**            the DataType is SAHPI_TL_TYPE_UNICODE or SAHPI_TL_TYPE_TEXT.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_OUT_OF_SPACE is returned if the Annunciator is not able to add
**      an additional announcement due to resource limits.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned if the Annunciator is in auto mode.
**
** Remarks:
**   The EntryId, Timestamp, and AddedByUser fields within the Announcement
**   parameter are not used by this function.  Instead, on successful
**   completion, these fields are set to new values associated with the added
**   announcement.  AddedByUser is always set to True.
**

**
**   Unless one of the error conditions described above are detected, or a

**      * FumiNum does not address a valid FUMI supported by the resource.
**      * BankNum is not 0 and not a valid bank number supported by the FUMI.
**
** Remarks:
**   Source information is required by the FUMI to correctly address the image
**   in the source repository. The HPI user provides it in the form of the URI.
**
**   The URI indicates the path to the source file and the access protocol.
**
**   Protocols that the FUMI can support are reported by the FUMI's RDR. The HPI
**   user shall make sure that the source URI corresponds to one of the
**   supported protocols, and that the source is accessible by the FUMI.
**
**   The HPI user calls this function to provide the source information to the
**   FUMI. The actual upgrade process can only be initiated after this
**   information has been set.
**
**   When a FUMI supports multiple banks, each bank has separate source
**   information.  The Bank ID of 0 can be used to set the source information
**   for the currently active bank.  When a FUMI does not support multiple

**
** Remarks:
**   This function checks the validity of the source image. It should also
**   report if the image represented by the URI matches the entity which the
**   FUMI is representing (i.e. if the image can be understood by the FUMI logic
**   and programmed into the underlying hardware). It could also do any type of
**   implementation dependent validation of the source. Some of the examples are
**   hash key or message digest validation.
**
**   The FUMI validates the URI on invocation of this API. Optionally, the FUMI
**   can start the validation process internally after the saHpiFumiSourceSet
**   function is called and can cache the result. It can then return the result
**   of validation immediately, once the saHpiFumiValidateSource function is
**   called.
**
**   When a FUMI supports multiple banks, each bank has separate source

**
**   When a FUMI does not support multiple banks, the HPI User shall use Bank 0
**   with this function.
**
**   The status of a source validate operation is reported via events, and can

**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the FumiNum does not address a valid
**      FUMI supported by the resource.
**
** Remarks:
**   This function is used for taking a backup of the image on the target in
**   preparation for upgrades. Depending on the implementation, this may mean
**   taking a backup on the hard drive or into another bank or in any other
**   location. In cases where the target already has a redundant image, the FUMI
**   may immediately report the backup is complete without making an additional
**   copy.
**
**   The status of a backup operation is reported via events, and can be queried
**   with the saHpiFumiUpgradeStatusGet() function.  When a FUMI supports
**   multiple banks, this function starts the backup operation for the active
**   bank.  Status of the backup operation will be associated with that bank.
**
**   As a result of executing this function the contents of one of the banks (if
**   available) might be overwritten..  Whether or not this occurs, and which
**   bank is used to hold the backup copy is implementation specific.  To copy
**   an image to a specific bank, the saHpiFumiBankCopy() function should be
**   used.
**
**   If an implementation supports HPI users initiating backups of the active
**   bank, it should be reflected in the FUMI capability flags in the RDR.  If
**   an implementation does not support this capability, backups may be created
**   automatically during the upgrade operation by the implementation.  If an
**   implementation does support the backup capability using this function,
**   automatic backups that would override the use of this function shall not be
**   created.

**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using

**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is

**
** Remarks:
**   This function accepts a parameter instructing each resource to impose a
**   delay before performing its default hot swap policy for auto-insertion.
**   The parameter may be set to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE to direct resources to
**   proceed immediately to auto-insertion, or to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK to prevent
**   auto-insertion from ever occurring.  If the parameter is set to another
**   value, then it defines the number of nanoseconds between the time a hot
**   swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INSERTION_PENDING is
**   generated, and the time that the auto-insertion policy is invoked for that
**   resource.  If, during this time period, a saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel()
**   function call is processed, the timer is stopped, and the auto-insertion
**   policy is not invoked.  Each domain maintains a single auto-insert timeout
**   value and it is applied to all contained resources upon insertion, which
**   support managed hot swap.
**
**   Once the auto-insertion policy begins, an HPI User is not allowed to cancel
**   the insertion policy; hence, the timeout should be set appropriately to
**   allow for this condition.  Note that the timeout period begins when the hot
**   swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INSERTION_PENDING is
**   initially generated; not when it is received by an HPI User with a
**   saHpiEventGet() function call, or even when it is placed in a session event
**   queue.
**
**   A resource may exist in multiple domains, which themselves may have
**   different auto-insertion timeout values.  Upon insertion, the resource
**   begins its auto-insertion policy based on the smallest auto-insertion
**   timeout value.  As an example, if a resource is inserted into two domains,
**   one with an auto-insertion timeout of 5 seconds, and one with an
**   auto-insertion timeout of 10 seconds, the resource begins its
**   auto-insertion policy at 5 seconds.
**
**   An implementation may enforce a fixed, preset timeout value.  In such
**   cases, the SAHPI_DOMAIN_CAP_AUTOINSERT_READ_ONLY flag is set to indicate

**   auto-extraction timeout value cannot be modified if the resource's "Hot
**   Swap AutoExtract Read-only" capability is set. After discovering that a
**   newly inserted resource supports Managed Hot Swap, and read-write
**   auto-extract timeouts, an HPI User may use this function to change the
**   timeout of the auto-extraction policy for that resource. If a resource
**   supports the simplified hot swap model, setting this timer has no effect
**   since the resource transitions directly to NOT PRESENT state on an
**   extraction.
**
**   An implementation may enforce a fixed, preset timeout value.  In such
**   cases, the SAHPI_HS_CAPABILITY_AUTOEXTRACT_READ_ONLY flag is set to
**   indicate that an HPI User cannot change the auto-extract Timeout value.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned if an HPI User attempts to change a
