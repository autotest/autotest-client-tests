GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG or GpgSM
easier for applications.  It provides a high-level crypto API for
encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
management.

GPGME uses inter-process communication to pass data back and forth between the application and the backend,
but the details of the communication protocol and invocation of the backend is completely hidden by the interface. All complexity is handled by GPGME

How to run the test:
-------------------
./gpgme.sh
