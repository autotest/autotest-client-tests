Description:
IO::HTML  provides an easy way to open a file containing HTML while
automatically determining its encoding.
This module opens a file and performs automatic charset detection based on the
HTML5 encoding sniffing algorithm.
You can then pass the filehandle to HTML::Parser or a related module (or just
read it yourself).
