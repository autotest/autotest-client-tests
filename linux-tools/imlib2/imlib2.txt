Assumptions:

	1. System running Fluxbox.
	2. The LTP is installed. (It has the executable used in this test.)

Purpose:

	Test that the imlib2 shared library is functional.

Instructions:

	1. Ensure that fluxbox is up and running (in a KVM image is fine):

		startx

	2. Open an xterm window.

	3. Change to the LTP directory with the executable for this
	   testcase. For example:

		cd /opt/fiv/fiv-ltp-<date>-NULL-1.0/testcases/fivextra/imlib2

	   This should contain a pairs of programs, named imlib2_convert and
	   imlib2_basic_dispay, plus a script imlib2_test.sh and a sample image
	   file named bombsquad.png.

	4. Run the script:

		./imlib2_test.sh

	   Expected Results:

		The image should be displayed in its own window for a few seconds.
		There will be console text displayed like the following:
			bombsquad.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
			image is 636 wide, 529 high
