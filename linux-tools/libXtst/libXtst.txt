Description: libXtst: This extension is a minimal set of client and server extensions
             required to completely test the X11 server with no user intervention.

Steps to test libXtst:

1) Login to the System under test using ssh with xwindows mode enabled.
   Ex: ssh -X root@test1.au.example.com

2) fakekey binary tests the API XTestFakeKeyEvent

  XTestFakeKeyEvent requests the server to simulate either a KeyPress (if is_press is True) or
  a KeyRelease (if is_press is False) of the key with the specified keycode; otherwise, the request is ignored.

  Execute the binary fakekey
  #./fakekey caps on
  Result: CapsLk will be on - Now whatever is typed should be in caps

  #./fakekey caps off
  Result: CapsLk key will be off - whatever typed should be in small letters

3) mouseevent binary tests the APIs XTestFakeButtonEvent and XTestFakeMotionEvent

   XTestFakeButtonEvent requests the server to simulate either a ButtonPress (if is_press is True) or a ButtonRelease
  (if is_press is False) of the logical button numbered by the specified button; otherwise, the request is ignored.

  XTestFakeMotionEvent requests the server to simulate a movement of the pointer to the specified position (x, y) on the
  root window of screen_number; otherwise, the request is ignored. If screen_number is -1, the current screen (that the pointer is on) is used.

  Execute the binary mouseevent

  #./mouseevent
  Result: Observe the movement of the cursor. The cursor will be moved to a new position and right button of the mouse will be clicked.

4) comparecursor binary tests the API XTestCompareCursorWithWindow

   XTestCompareCurrentCursorWithWindow performs a comparison of the current cursor with the cursor of the specified window returning
   True if they are the same and False otherwise. If the extension is not supported, then the request is ignored and zero is returned.

   Execute the binary comparecursor

   #./comparecursor
   Result: A small window with black screen should be opened at the top left corner

5) grabcontrol tests the API XTestGrabControl, XTestFakeButtonEvent, XTestFakeMotionEvent and XTestQueryExtension

   XTestQueryExtension returns True if the specified display supports the XTEST extension, else False.

   XTestGrabControl cause the executing client to become impervious to server grabs. That is, it can continue to execute requests even if another client grabs the server.

   Execute the binary grabcontrol

   #./grabcontrol 10 30
   Result: It should able to grab the control of your system. At this pixel position "Window menu" on your terminal on the top left corner is grabbed.
           Window menu drop down box should be opened.
