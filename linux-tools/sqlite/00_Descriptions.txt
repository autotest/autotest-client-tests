Sqlite3

Description :
SQLite library includes a command-line utility named
sqlite3 that allows the user to manually enter
and execute SQL commands against an SQLite database.

This test simply checks that the sqlite3 starts and executes basic  database commands such as creating a sample db,
 inserting data into table and dropping the table.
We assume other functions are well tested by community.

Execution:
Execute sqlite.sh to run the test.
