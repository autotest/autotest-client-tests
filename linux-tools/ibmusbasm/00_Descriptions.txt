# TestCase	ibmusbasm.sh
#
# Description:  Test the USB interface to RSAII
#
# Tool Dependency:
#
#               This testcase depends on the command line tool mpcli. The
#               version used here was found at:
#
# 		http://www.ibmquicklinks.com/
#
#		In the above page search for :
#               "Management Processor Command Line Interface (MPCLI)
#               version"
#
#               This will bring you to a place where you can download an RPM
#               for the mpcli tool. (In my case the RPM was cryptically
#               named "41y7832l.rpm"). This RPM contains two tarballs, one
#               for a Java JRE and one for the tool itself.
#
#               The tarball for the tool itself (asmcli.tgz) is included
#               with and will be installed by this testcase. The JRE
#               included in the above RPM is not included here as it is
#               quite large
#
#               The tool's normal startup script,
#               /opt/IBMmpcli/bin/MPCLI.sh, expects to use the JRE supplied
#               with the RPM. The script mpcli.sh in this directory is
#               derived from MPCLI.sh
